This is part of my garden project, which includes some information on the herb garden we started with my children during a lockdown. It includes the most common herbs, the countdown clock to be able to plant outdoors again and harvest/maturity days.

IMPORTANT: 
To run this project, please contact me for the google colab link.

The other way to do it is to download ipynb file and run it in google colab. On more information on how to run it, please see https://colab.research.google.com/

The py. files that you see are also in colab file.

countdown.py: contains countdown clock to the time we can start planting again.

weather.py: contains weather API for your city.

This project uses the following packages:
- pandas as pd
- matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- requests
- datetime
- xlsxwriter

The following requirements were met:

- Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app.
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event).
- Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application.
- Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data.
