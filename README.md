This is part of my garden project, which includes some information on the herb garden we started with my children during a lockdown. It includes the most common herbs, their pictures, latin names and harvest/maturity days.

img folder: contains images used on my site. Images were downloaded from unsplash.com and are free for personal use.

countdown.py: contains countdown clock to the time we can start planting again.

weather.py: contains weather API for your city.

contact_form.py: contains regex for my contact form.


IMPORTANT: please 

New features added: regex in contact form, API in weather.py and server.js, API fetch request in directory.js and harvest countdown clock.

The following requirements were met:

- Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
- Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app
- Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)
- Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
